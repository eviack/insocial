### Input
User-provided text or social media posts.

### Data Preprocessing
- Employed natural language processing (NLP) techniques for data preprocessing, including:
  - Stop words removal
  - Stemming
  - Lemmatization

### Sentiment Analysis Techniques
- Utilized advanced NLP techniques, including sentiment lexicons and machine learning models.
- Developed an ML model to classify textual data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories.
- Leveraged NLP models from `Hugging Face transformers` to achieve exceptional accuracy in sentiment classification.
- Utilized `VADER` (NLP-based model) for bulk data analysis.
- Trained a `naive Bayes classifier` specifically for analyzing reviews.

### Dataset
- Size ranges from 40,000 to 50,000 samples.

### Output
Sentiment scores and visualizations depicting sentiment trends.
